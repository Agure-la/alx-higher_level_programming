0x00. Python - Hello, World
0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
0x02. Python - import & modules
0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
0x05. Python - Exceptions
0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
0x07. Python - Test-driven development
0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects
0x09. Python - Everything is object
0x0A. Python - Inheritance
0x0B. Python - Input/Output
