             **PYTHON PROGRAMMING**

Python is a high-level, versatile, and easy-to-read programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It offers a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and more. With its clean syntax and extensive standard library, Python enables developers to write concise code that is both powerful and expressive. It emphasizes code readability, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Python's community-driven development and robust ecosystem of libraries and frameworks contribute to its popularity and continued growth.

# Higher-level programming - Python

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming track at ALX Africa. In these projects, which began occurring in month four of the year one curriculum, I am currently learning Python.
Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)
* [0x00. AirBnB clone - The console](https://github.com/Aysuarex/AirBnB_clone)
* [0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
* [0x02. Python - import & modules](./0x02-python-import_modules)
* [0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](./0x03-python-data_structures)
* [0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](./0x04-python-more_data_structures)
* [0x05. Python - Exceptions](./0x05-python-exception)
* [0x06. Python - Classes and Objects](./0x06-python-classes)
* [0x07. Python - Test-driven development](./0x07-python-test_driven_development)
* [0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects](./0x08-python-more_classes)
* [0x09. Python - Everything is object](./0x09-python-everything_is_object)
* [0x0A. Python - Inheritance](./0x0A-python-inheritance)
* [0x0B. Python - Input/Output](./0x0B-python-input_output)
* [0x0C. Python - Almost a circle](./0x0C-python-almost_a_circle)
* [0x0D. SQL - Introduction](./0x0D-SQL_introduction)
